## Introduction

This repository contains code solutions for a variety of C programming questions and exercises, designed to align with the curriculum of Tribhuvan University (TU). The solutions are organized and categorized by different topics and concepts covered in the TU curriculum, making it easier for TU students to navigate and find the relevant code.

Whether you are a student currently enrolled in a TU C programming course or looking for reference solutions for TU-specific problems, this repository aims to provide you with a valuable resource for your learning journey.

## Folder Structure

The code solutions are organized into folders based on different topics and categories covered in the TU C programming curriculum. Each folder represents a specific concept or problem domain. Here is the current folder structure:

1. [L00_PatternPrinting](L00_PatternPrinting/)
2. [L01_BasicInputAndOutput](L01_BasicInputAndOutput/)
3. [L02_SelectiveStructures](L02_SelectiveStructures/)
4. [L03_SelectiveStructures](L03_SelectiveStructures/)
5. [L04_IterativeStructures](L04_IterativeStructures/)
6. [L05_IterativeStructures](L05_IterativeStructures/)
7. [L06_Functions](L06_Functions/)
8. [L07_Recursions](L07_Recursions/)
9. [L08_Arrays](L08_Arrays/)
10. [L09_ArraysWithFunctions](L09_ArraysWithFunctions/)
11. [L10_Strings](L10_Strings/)
12. [L11_Pointers](L11_Pointers/)
